March 04, 2025 

This repository refers to 'Mapping the landscape of social behavior' by
Ugne Klibaite, Tianqing Li, Diego Aldarondo, Jumana F. Akoad, Bence P. Ã–lveczky, Timothy W. Dunn. 

Here, you will find sample scripts and utilities for performing the behavioral embeddings described in the paper.
